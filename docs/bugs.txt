Active:
- ZONE: major slowdown (pause) playing a deck with many zones (after creating new zones?)
- SYNC: at some point (after closing a deck?) a deck may refuse to sync its tempo

Fixed:
- LOAD: crash on .bpm files with no zones defined
- LOOP: zone loop syncs could be lost after graph zoom changed
- SYNC: jumping to cue stops playing song if both decks autosynced and other deck stopped
